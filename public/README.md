# Asian Show Tracker

## üìΩ INTRODUCTION

### <u>**Project Overview:**</u>
This is a Web Application that enables users to interact with an API from The MovieDB to display Asian TV Shows. This application allows users to bookmark their favourite shows to a personalised list, and keeps track of their viewing times with a statistical graph that is updated monthly. The app uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS for frontend, Node.js for server-side operations, and relies on the API for its backend data.

### <u>**Purpose:**</u>
This application streamlines the viewing journey of Asian drama enthusiasts with a centralized, user-friendly tracking platform. It retains a comprehensive record of their TV consumption, aiding reflection on preferences and facilitating the discovery of new favorite shows.

### <u>**Target User:**</u>
This application caters to the diverse range of Asian TV show viewers, ranging from avid fans to casual viewers, aged 15 to 35.

## üìΩ FEATURES
Description of the features and functionalities...
(Describe the features and functionalities of your application. Explain how users can add new shows, view a list of shows, click to see more details, and delete existing shows.)

1. **Fetch Data from API**: The application fetches TV shows data from TheMovieDB API using the fetch() method. The JSON data is then parsed, and the relevant parts are extracted and displayed on the page.

2. **Bookmark Shows**: Users can bookmark their favorite shows to a personalized list called "Your Collection". The application stores the list locally using the localStorage object in JavaScript.

3. **Plot Graph**: Uses the Plotly.js library to plot the users' monthly watch time for different category of Asian TV shows (e.g. Korean Drama, Thai Drama, etc...) using a multiple line graph.

4. **Interactive Search**: The web app allows users to search for their favorite shows through a search input box.

5. **Review Form**: Users can click on the "+Add Review" button to open a pop-up form to add new review of their watched TV shows.

6. **Clear Collection List**: User can clear their entire saved TV show collection in the localStorage by clicking the "Clear Collection" button.
